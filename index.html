					<h2>The Name of the Game is Anxiety</h2>
					<p>I have always been fairly anxious as a baseline, and have usually self-medicated this anxiety with long, involved projects. This has manifested in all kinds of forms—I have organized and re-organized my basement; I made my own hobbying table; I re-arrange furniture, redo storage systems, etc. When the pandemic began, I threw myself into a lot of different pursuits to ease the burden of witnessing a lot of terrible decision-making by people with more power over my life than me. 
                  <br>
                  First, I made myself a media server and uploaded all my blu-rays and DVDs onto it, basically making my own home Netflix. 
                  <br>
                  <figure>
                     <img src="images/server.jpg" alt="The glow lights actually make it travel through time."  width="800" 
                     height="800"

                     </figure>
                  Then my wife and I got really into puzzles and board games.
                  </p>
                  <figure>

                      />
                     <figcaption><em>my collection is like these, only ones you actually want to play.</em>

					<h2>Mobile Suit Fundam</h2>
					<p>Then I picked up an older hobby—Gunpla. This is something that grew out of two other hobbies—building LEGO and collecting Transformers toys. “Gunpla” stands for “Gundam Plastic Models”—they’re cool, intricate model kits of suits of mechanized armor, based on the various anime series from the Mobile Suit Gundam universe. 
                  <br>
                  There’s like two dozen Gundam animated series at this point, but the basic plot is always that some young person finds a Gundam suit, gets wrapped up in a war, and makes about fifty long-winded passionate speeches about how war is bad and how they’re going to fight a war to end war. It’s very anime. </p>

                  <figcaption><em>This is the RX-78 suit, but you and I both know I could just making that up.</em>
					</figure>

               <p>To build Gunpla, you need nippers and a hobby knife to cut the pieces out of the sprues they come on, and sometimes some sandpaper to make everything look clean. 
                  
                  <br>
                  But I wanted more—I saw pictures on Instagram about how people had their models looking awesome, and I was interested in doing the same for mine. 
                  
                  <br>
                  
                  Over and over, I saw the same advice—get an airbrush. </p>

                  <figure>
                     <img src="images/PaascheAirbrush.jpg" alt="look at this fancy tool!" 
                     width="800"
                     height="800"/>
                     <figcaption><em>I have never seen anyone use an airbrush that looks like this.</em></figcaption>
                  </figure>

					<p>With an airbrush, you can take a model and repaint it from the bottom up. You can also add a finish—a matte or satin or gloss varnish that gives the model a certain effect. 
                  
                  <br>
                  The problem with this was that it takes a long time to build a Gunpla model, usually. For the average model, for me, it took about a week from opening the box to full assembly. This is what drew me to the hobby to begin with—longer projects mean less chances for anxiety to creep in—but now it meant that I couldn’t easily tool around with my new airbrush toy. 
                  <br>
                  Then I remembered Warhammer.

					<h2>"In the Cold Darkness of the Grim Dark Future, There is Only War."</h2>
					<p>Warhammer 40000 is a science-fiction universe that features small plastic kit models, a tabletop war game, video games, vast and intricate swathes of epic-scale novels and short stories, several animation series, and more. I had enjoyed a lot of the video games for a while, but didn’t really know too much about the tabletop game—which is where everything else (the games, novels, etc.) spun off from. 
                  
                  <br>
                  It is a satirical setting, purposefully dark and grim (or “grimdark”) to mock some of humanity’s worst systems and institutions. For example, humanity’s main faction—the Imperium of Man—is a backwards fascist theocracy of a million worlds and trillions of souls that is buried inside of a bureaucracy that is too big to fail. One of the units you can have on the tabletop for this faction is a giant tank with a church on top of it that shoots rockets out of its organ pipes:
                  <figure>
                     <img src="images/exorcist.webp" alt="maybe you thought I was joking?" width="800" 
                     height="800"/>
                     <figcaption><em>Oh also there's flying zombie cyborg babies, so there's that.</em></figcaption>
                  </figure>
                  <br>
                  This universe is full of more than two dozen factions, each of which is completely morally reprehensible in their own way—and this is the fun of the setting. When everyone is equally grimdark, there’s no real qualms—in a competitive setting on the tabletop—in destroying an opponent’s forces. 
                  </p>

					<a name="The Hobby"></a>
					<h2>The Hobby</h2>
					<p>In essence, the idea of this hobby is that you make an army from small plastic models that the company Games Workshop sells, and you fight against someone else who has done the same. Games of a standard size can last for three or four hours, taking up afternoons or evenings.  The game is full of complicated rules and everyone gets them wrong all the time; there is a lot of time just looking up rules even for veteran players of the game. 
                  <br>
                  So, back to Gunpla—I saw something related to Warhammer and thought—these little models seem simple to make in a rush. Then I’ll have lots to practice my airbrushing skills on, and I won’t screw up the Gunpla I’ve been working on for a week or longer. 
                  <br>
                  I found a “starter” box that featured two small forces—one for myself, and one for my wife. I built them, airbrushed them, painted in all the details, and two years later I think I’ve only built one Gunpla all the way through since. 
               <br>
               Whoops.   
               
               </p>
	   			<funparagraph id="testp">Between learning the complicated rules of the game, building the cool models they release, reading novels about the major events of the universe, and painting up an army or two (or three…or four…), the various parts of my anxious brain are usually pretty well-sated. One problem I always had with LEGO or Gunpla was that you can’t really do anything with it once you have it made. And I loved the fiction surrounding Gundam, even though it was melodramatic and over-the-top, but there is nothing more over-the-top than Warhammer 40000, where casual battles feature the annihilation of entire planets and civilizations in the most outrageous ways possible. 
               </funparagraph>
                  <br>
                  I do, however, have a lot of really cool painted models, so there is that.
